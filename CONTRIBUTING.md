### How to Sign Off

Add a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit messages:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add new feature"
```

The `-s` flag automatically adds the sign-off line with your name and email:

```
Add new feature

```

### Signing Off Previous Commits

If you forgot to sign off your commits, you can amend them:

```bash
# For the last commit
git commit --amend --signoff

# For multiple commits (interactive rebase)
git rebase -i HEAD~N  # where N is the number of commits
# Mark commits as 'edit', then for each:
git commit --amend --signoff
git rebase --continue
```

**Important:** All commits in a PR must be signed off. PRs without sign-offs will not be merged.

## Coding Standards

- Follow standard Go conventions and idiomatic Go code
- Run `go fmt` before committing (or use `make fmt`)
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Write unit tests for new code
- Keep PRs focused - one feature/fix per PR
- Update CRDs by modifying `api/v1alpha1/*_types.go` then run `make manifests generate`

## Project Structure

```
valkey-operator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/v1alpha1/          # CRD definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/                   # Main application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/                # Kubernetes manifests and Kustomize configs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/controller/   # Controller reconciliation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                  # Documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                  # E2E and integration tests
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Run E2E tests (requires cluster)
make test-e2e

# Run specific tests
go test ./internal/controller/... -v
```

## Making Changes to the API

If you need to modify the ValkeyCluster CRD:

1. Edit `api/v1alpha1/valkeycluster_types.go`
2. Add kubebuilder markers for validation and defaults
3. Regenerate manifests: `make manifests generate`
4. Update the sample CR in `config/samples/`
5. Test with `make install` to apply the updated CRD

## Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make code changes
vim internal/controller/valkeycluster_controller.go

# 2. Update generated code and manifests
make generate manifests

# 3. Run tests
make test

# 4. Test locally
make install    # Install CRDs
make run        # Run controller locally

# 5. Build and test container
make docker-build IMG=valkey-operator:dev
make deploy IMG=valkey-operator:dev
```
